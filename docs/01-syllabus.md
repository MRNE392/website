## Course description {-}
In this course, students conduct ecological monitoring on the St. Mary’s River. We will use a variety of sampling methods to measure chemical concentrations, animal abundances, and metabolic rates in the estuarine environment. We'll also use quality assurance/quality control measures to clean their data before it is published to our publicly available data dashboard. This 2-credit course meets once per week and also requires students to work in groups outside of class meetings to collect and process samples. Students should be prepared to work outdoors in inclement weather.

## Course materials {-}
All of the readings and software in this class are either free or will be provided by the instructor.

## Fieldwork {-}
This course involves a lot of outdoor work. Sometimes the weather will be beautiful, but more often it will be hot, sunny, buggy, cold, wet, windy, or a combination of these uncomfortable conditions. It is important that you come to class prepared with whatever you need to keep yourself safe and comfortable outside. It's always a good idea to have a hat and sunscreen and a waterproof layer, even if rain is not in the forecast. For boat work, it is almost always much cooler on the water than land unless it's very hot out out, so come prepared with multiple layers. I recommend investing in good rain gear if you haven't already. 

## Learning outcomes {-}
At the completion of this course, students will have an in-depth understanding of why and how we conduct ecological monitoring in coastal systems. 

Specific outcomes include being able to:

* describe ecological and policy context of coastal monitoring
* describe coastal monitoring methods and procedures
* conduct coastal monitoring independently and with a team using correct and appropriate methods and procedures


## Grading {-}
This course uses a variation of "specifications grading," where we rely less on evaluating every assignment with a letter or number and instead focus on making sure we're generally making good progress in our learning. [Research has shown](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/) that grading doesn't improve learning and can sometimes even harm learning. Rather than submitting work "in exchange" for a letter or number grade, most assignments will be evaluated based on whether or not they meet the "specifications," or "specs" of that particular assignment. If the specs are not met, you'll typically have the opportunity to revise your assignment until the specs are met so that you have more than one chance to demonstrate your learning. Your final grade will be based on the number of assignments for which you meet the specs and, therefore, demonstrate your mastery of each particular topic. With this approach to evaluation, the focus is more on truly becoming an expert in the course content and less on nit-picking over points. 

The following outlines how grades are earned:

* **A:** Meet specs on at least xx quizzes/homeworks; earn at least 90% on final exam
* **B:** Meet specs on at least xx quizzes/homeworks; earn at least 80% on final exam
* **C:** Meet specs on at least xx quizzes/homeworks; earn at least 70% on final exam
* **D:** Meet specs on at least xx quizzes/homeworks; earn at least 70% on final exam; 3 or more unexplained absences* 
* **F:** Meet specs on less than xx quizzes/homeworks; earn less than a 70% on final exam; 3 or more unexplained absences*

*Unexplained absence: Missing class without notifying the professor (in other words, “ghosting” the class). As long as you let the instructor know you won’t be able to make it to class, an absence is considered “explained,” no doctor’s note or other official documentation needed. Please don’t come to class if you are sick! Just be sure to keep me in the loop via a quick email.

On the flip side, please consider the consequences of missing class meetings – this is a very hands-on course where most of the learning takes place in person. It will be hard to learn and, therefore, pass the class if you’re not here to participate. This is why attendance is included in the specs for earning a D or F in the class: since we only meet once a week, missing 3 class sessions is equal to missing three weeks of class. If we are not in close communication about your absences, catching up on this much missed work will be difficult if not impossible. IMHO, this course is fun and interesting with many practical applications for your future career in marine science and adjacent fields, so hopefully this won’t be an issue because you’ll be excited to come to class! ;-)

**Homework assignments and quizzes**

Formative assessments will generally take the form of written and practical quizzes and homework assignments. They are designed to 1) help the instructor monitor how well you’re learning and 2) help you monitor your own learning and make adjustments to improve. These assignments can be revised during class based on discussion with your peers and instructor so that you can identify and correct any misconceptions your may have and consider how you might improve your study habits. Learning outcomes for each week will be provided and each quiz/homework assignment will clearly assess those outcomes. Since the final exam will be assessing the same learning outcomes, these assignments will also serve as great study material for the exams.

Quizzes and homework assignments are evaluated on a “meets specs/does not meet specs” basis to avoid stressing over every point earned and lost. To meet specs on a quiz or homework assignment (unless otherwise noted), your work should be at least 50% correct before revision and at least 85% correct after revision with an honest reflection on any revisions made. Quizzes can be made up during the instructor’s office hours but revisions are not possible on make-up quizzes since they are based on in-class peer collaboration. Missed quizzes must be made up within two weeks of the day you missed the quiz.

**Final exam**

Summative assessments evaluate your learning and proficiency at the end of the course. The summative assessment in this course will take the form of a cumulative exam that has both a written and practical component. The written portion will assess your understanding of the ecological and policy context of coastal monitoring and your grasp on monitoring methods. For the practical component, we’ll schedule individual meetings in which you demonstrate your ability to properly calibrate instruments, collect samples, etc. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be provided for the practical exam but tasks must be completed within the time provided. Students can use one page of hand-written notes for the written exam portion. The final exam cannot be revised but the course and policies are designed so that you will learn a lot (and therefore do well on the exams) as long as you show up and do the work! If you need to miss the final exam, please contact the instructor to reschedule it.

**Extra credit**

The specs grading system is designed to reduce anxiety over grades, but I recognize that you still may experience some stress over the final exam, especially if your exam grade is just below the benchmark for a particular course grade. I will include multiple opportunities for extra credit that will enable you to add up to three points to your final exam grade so that if, for example, you earn a 78% on the exam, your extra credit points can increase the grade to an 80% and you can, therefore earn a B in the class). Several extra credit opportunities are already listed on the class website and more will be added and announced throughout the semester.

## More information {-}

### Attendance and late work {-}
It is very important that you regularly attend class. Everything we do builds on previously covered topics. So if you miss class or lab, you risk falling behind. I also know that life happens! If you need to miss class or lab, first make sure to communicate this with me. Then check the class [schedule](https://enst222.github.io/website/schedule.html) to see what you missed, review relevant slides and readings, and complete missed assignments on your own. If group-based project work took place, be sure to communicate with your team ASAP to come up with a plan for how you will contribute. Since this is an ungraded course, I will not automatically dock your grade due to absences. However, when you write your mid-semester and final learning reflections, you should carefully consider your attendance record - especially repeated absences - may have impacted your learning and, therefore, your grade.

I am similarly flexible about late work. If you need an extra day or two to complete an assignment, just ask - it's usually not a problem. However, you should think about the purpose of a particular due date and how a late submission will affect your learning. In the case of projects, a late submission might mean you will miss the opportunity to get feedback on your work. For assignments and data challenges, you might miss the chance to work collaboratively with your peers to solve stubborn data or coding challenges. You should take these learning opportunities into consideration before requesting an extension.

### Engaged learning {-}
SMCM has recently decreased the amount of time allocated to class meetings. To maintain the rigor of our 2-credit courses, students are expected to spend time outside of normal class meeting times engaging with course material. In this class, students can expect engaged learning to consist of hands-on monitoring activities.

### Office hours {-}
Office hours are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me.

**The Writing and Speaking Center:** Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing & Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences—just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other.
