An emphasis will be placed on research question formulation and sampling design. By the end of the course, students will be able to independently develop a field study, collect and analyze field data, and present their findings in a poster presentation. We will focus on our local estuarine environment, although the general research process covered can be applied to any system. Course materials All of the readings in this class are either free or will be provided by the instructor. Working outside This course involves a lot of outdoor work. Sometimes the weather will be beautiful, but more often it will be hot, sunny, buggy, cold, wet, windy, or a combination of these uncomfortable conditions. We will go out rain or shine unless the conditions are unsafe. It is important that you come to class prepared with whatever you need to keep yourself safe and comfortable outside. It’s always a good idea to have a hat and sunscreen and a waterproof layer, even if rain is not in the forecast. For boat work, it is almost always much cooler on the water than land, especially in the spring and winter, so come prepared with multiple layers. Closed-toe shoes are required on the boat. Crocs or sneakers are fine in warm weather. Rubber boots are ideal in cooler weather but sneakers or anything with a grippy rubber sole are fine too. Do not wear flip-flops, heels, or nice shoes that can’t get wet or that could scuff up the boat deck. I recommend investing in good rain gear, especially if you plan to continue doing fieldwork on the water beyond this class. Grundens is a reputable marine work gear supplier and they have some affordable options. Outdoor Research also sells high-quality gear and you can apply for a student discount. Learning outcomes At the completion of this course, students will be able to design and conduct ecological field investigations using proper scientific methods. Specific outcomes include being able to: Formulate and articulate hypotheses or questions about observed ecological phenomena Develop and articulate an appropriate field study design to test hypotheses or address research questions Use appropriate methods to collect ecological field data Record and manage detailed ecological data, including field procedures, site observations and quantitative field measurements Analyze observational and experimental field data and report results in the form of a conference-style poster presentation Collaborate effectively with a diverse team of researchers and learners Grading and assessment This course uses a variation of “specifications grading,” where we rely less on evaluating every assignment with a letter or number and instead focus on making sure we’re generally making good progress in our learning. Research has shown that grading doesn’t improve learning and can sometimes even harm learning. Rather than submitting work “in exchange” for a letter or number grade, most assignments will be evaluated based on whether or not they meet the “specifications,” or “specs” of that particular assignment. If the specs are not met, you’ll often have the opportunity to revise your assignment until the specs are met so that you have more than one chance to demonstrate your learning. Your final grade will be based on the number of assignments for which you meet the specs and, therefore, demonstrate your mastery of the course topics. With this approach to evaluation, the goal is to emphasize truly becoming an expert in the course content. The following outlines how grades are earned: A Meet specs on: at least 9/10 quizzes, 4/4 lab reports, and poster B Meet specs on: at least 8/10 quizzes, 3/4 lab reports, and poster C Meet specs on: at least 7/10 quizzes, 2/4 lab reports, and poster D Meet specs on: at least 6/10 quizzes, 1/4 lab reports, and poster, and/or student has 4 or more unexplained absences* F Does not meet one or more of the requirements to earn a D, and/or student has 4 or more unexplained absences* Unexplained absence Missing class without notifying the professor (in other words, “ghosting” the class). As long as you let the instructor know you won’t be able to make it to class, an absence is considered “explained,” no doctor’s note or other official documentation needed. Please don’t come to class if you are sick! Just be sure to keep me in the loop via a quick email. On the flip side, please consider the consequences of missing class meetings – this is a very hands-on course where most of the learning takes place in person. It will be hard to learn and, therefore, pass the class if you’re not here to participate. This is why attendance is included in the specs for earning a D or F in the class: since we only meet once a week, missing 3 class sessions is equal to missing three weeks of class. If we are not in close communication about your absences, catching up on this much missed work will be difficult if not impossible. IMHO, this course is fun and interesting with many practical applications for your future career in marine science and adjacent fields, so hopefully this won’t be an issue because you’ll be excited to come to class! Quizzes Formative assessments will generally take the form of quizzes. They are designed to 1) help the instructor monitor how well you’re learning and 2) help you monitor your own learning and make adjustments to improve. Quizzes can be revised during class based on discussion with your peers and instructor so that you can identify and correct any misconceptions your may have and consider how you might improve your study habits. Learning outcomes for each week will be provided and each quiz will clearly assess those outcomes. Since the final exam will be assessing the same learning outcomes, these assignments will also serve as great study material for the exams. Quizzes are evaluated on a “meets specs/does not meet specs” basis to avoid stressing over every point earned and lost. To meet specs on a quiz (unless otherwise noted), your work should be at least 50% correct before revision and at least 85% correct after revision with an honest reflection on any revisions made. Quizzes can be made up during the instructor’s office hours but revisions are not possible on make-up quizzes since they are based on in-class peer collaboration. Missed quizzes must be made up within two weeks of the day you missed the quiz. Lab reports Final exam Summative assessments evaluate your learning and proficiency at the end of the course. The summative assessment in this course will take the form of a cumulative exam that has both a written and practical component. The written portion will assess your understanding of the ecological and policy context of coastal monitoring and your grasp of proper monitoring methods. For the practical component, we’ll schedule individual meetings in which you demonstrate your ability to properly calibrate instruments, collect samples, etc. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be provided for the practical exam but tasks must be completed within the time provided. Students can use one page of hand-written notes for the written exam portion. The final exam cannot be revised but the course structure and policies are intentionally designed to help you learn a lot (and therefore do well on the exams) as long as you show up and do the work! If you need to miss the final exam, please contact the instructor to reschedule it. Extra credit The specs grading system is designed to reduce anxiety over grades, but I recognize that you still may experience some stress over the quizzes and assignments, especially if you are just below the benchmark for a particular course grade or you would like the opportunity to earn a “plus” grade. I will offer multiple opportunities that will enable you to earn an extra credit point, which you can use as a “free pass” to automatically meet specs on a quiz or add a “plus” to your grade. So if, for example, if you only meet the specs on 7 quizzes but you need to pass 8 to earn a B, you can use your extra credit point to automatically pass your missing quiz. Or if you met all of the requirements for a B, but you’d really like to earn a B+, you can use your extra credit point to add a “+” to your final grade. There are no “-” final grades in this class. Several extra credit opportunities are already listed on the class website and more will be added and announced throughout the semester. More policies Attendance and late work If you need to miss class, first make sure to communicate this with me. Then check the class schedule to see what you missed, review relevant slides and readings, and complete missed assignments on your own. If you missed a quiz, contact me to reschedule it. Missed quizzes must be made up within 2 weeks. I am similarly flexible about late work. If you need an extra day or two to complete an assignment, just ask - it’s usually not a problem. However, you should think about the purpose of a particular due date and how a late submission will affect your learning. In the case of projects, a late submission might mean you will miss the opportunity to get feedback on your work. For assignments and data challenges, you might miss the chance to work collaboratively with your peers to solve stubborn data or coding challenges. You should take these learning opportunities into consideration before requesting an extension. Engaged learning SMCM has recently decreased the amount of time allocated to class meetings. Because our course meeting times are longer than required for a 2-credit course, most of our “engaged learning” will take place via hands-on activities in class. Occasionally, students will also make some monitoring measurements on their own outside of class. Office hours Office hours are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me during that time. SMCM resources Accommodations and Accessibility: SMCM is committed to providing access to the learning and living experience to students with disabilities and disabling health conditions. If you have received a letter from the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS), which outlines the academic accommodations to which you are entitled to and you want those accommodations to apply to this course, you MUST share your letter and meet with me to review that letter. If you suspect that you have a learning or living need related to a disability or disabling health condition that could benefit from accommodations, you should contact the Office of Accessibility Services, who can help you learn more about how to proceed.

The Writing and Speaking Center: Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing &amp; Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences—just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other. To make an appointment, please visit www.smcm.edu/writingcenter and click the “Schedule an Appointment” button. If you have questions or need assistance, please contact Director Ben Click at baclick@smcm.edu.
